\chapter{Implementation}
\label{IMPL}
The implementation is structured in two main parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item the DSL, called \textit{Scalala}
\item the Web-Application, called \textit{ScalalaKata}
\end{itemize}

The first section describes the overarching DSL implementation. It starts by explaining the concept of the language, discussing design aspects and the final implementation in Scala. The section then proceeds to introduce the web-application and each component of it. It explains the client-server implementation; particular attention is paid to the Scala.js sections. Both, the DSL and Web-Application, are merged in chapter \ref{RESULTS} to provide the holistic approach as a result of combining each component.

The interested reader is invited to read along in the project's source code at GitHub\footnote{ScalalaKata - \url{https://github.com/FunkeMT/ScalalaKata}}, to compare the illustrated concepts and verify the following chapters themselves.
