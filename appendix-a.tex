(A)                  		& \begin{itemize}
\item "I tried to map familiar programming concepts to the new syntax like I am doing this whenever I am confronted with new programming languages."
\item "To save things for later, I tried to comment out particular parts like the variable usage, but it was not possible. So I had to delete it completely."
\item "The problem why I was not able to copy the sheet-music into the script was that I do not know sheet-notes or music. This was kinda frustrating. So I tried to create music randomly."
\item "The error messages were not helpful at all."
\end{itemize} \\
(B)                 		& \begin{itemize}
\item "I understood the concept of the definition of a musician and the usage of it because I saw it in the example."
\item "Because I am familiar with music notation, it was really easy for me to create a children's song, and I was surprised at how easy it was."
\item "I tried to create more complex music according to the example, it was possible, but it was seriously hard for me to type it because I am not familiar to write music in this style."
\item "When I got an error, I tried to understand the message and repair the error, but for me, it was too confusing."
\end{itemize} \\
(C)                 		& \begin{itemize}
\item "After I took a first look at the program, I did not think about a programming language at all. I compared it immediately to music notation."
\item "It was nevertheless disappointing that I could not write 'cis'. But now, I know that it should teach the programming language, and now it makes sense that a note should illustrate an object."
\item "The 'loop' construct entirely worked as expected."
\item "The 'time' concept was a bit confusing since musicians are used to think in another time concept, in bars."
\end{itemize}
